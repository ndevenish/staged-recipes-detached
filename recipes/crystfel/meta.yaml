  summary: 'Data processing for serial crystallography'
  description: |
    CrystFEL is a suite of programs for processing (and simulating) Bragg
    diffraction data from "serial crystallography" experiments, often (but
    not always) performed using an X-ray Free-Electron Laser.  Compared to
    rotation data, some of the particular characteristics of such data which
    call for a specialised software suite are:

    - The sliced, rather than integrated, measurement of intensity data.
      Many, if not all reflections are partially integrated.
    - Many patterns (thousands) are required - high throughput is needed.
    - The crystal orientations in each pattern are random and uncorrelated.
    - Merging into lower symmetry point groups may require the resolution
      of indexing ambiguities.
